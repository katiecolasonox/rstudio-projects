# Bike Accidents in Madrid: How Bike Sharing, Traffic, and Weather Influence Incidents
### Summary: 
In recent years, bike-sharing services have gained increasing popularity as an eco-friendly and
efficient means of transportation around the world. As such a service quickly evolves, however,
the concerns for ridersâ€™ safety naturally arise. This paper delves into the case of BiciMAD, the
municipalized bike-sharing system in Madrid, Spain, which has grown to encompass over 7500
electric bikes serving 21 districts. This study seeks to uncover the potential impact of traffic,
weather, and shared bike use on bike-related accidents. Our initial hypothesis was that traffic
volume and the amount of rainfall are substantial factors in predicting the number of bike-related
accidents. A logistic regression model using the hourly traffic volume, the shared bike rental
use, and precipitation as the predictors reveals the significant positive effect of the first two
predictors on the bike-related accident. Upon further analysis, a temporal factor considering the
time of the day seems to provide better results when predicting the likelihood of cycling
accidents.The model could further be improved by integrating additional variables, such as
geographical locations and seasonality.
